# Face_Recognition_COMP3007


In this project, traditional approaches and a deep learning approach for face recognition were evaluated based on a public facial dataset. The face images were captured in different poses and different lighting conditions. The main approach to recognise the facial images consists of three steps: 1) Facial Localisation 2) Facial Feature Extraction 3) Facial Classification.

All the implementation was based on MATLAB. The primary contributions of this project cover three aspects and will be described in this paperwork:

- Traditional methods have been implemented to find the one with the best performance.

- A modern face recognition approach powered by deep learning technique has been adopted to show the state-of-art performance.

- All approaches have been evaluated in comparison with the given baseline.

The result shows that the deep learning approach is robust to handle the facial recognition challenges, such as lighting condition, occlusion, and face expression.
